This repository contains a labs to help you get started with Creating and deploying Azure machine learning module. For the following Microsoft [Learn Exercise](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/train-package-module-iot-edge/3-exercise-create-deploy-azure-ml-module)

## Manually creating a VS Online Container

To complete the labs, you'll need the following:

- A Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at <a href ='https://azure.microsoft.com' target='_blank'>https://azure.microsoft.com</a> or a Student Subscription at <a href ='https://aks.ms/azureforstudents' target='_blank'>https://aka.ms/azureforstudents</a>.
- A Visual Studio Online environment. This provides a hosted instance of Visual Studio Code, in which you'll be able to run the notebooks for the lab exercises. To set up this environment:
    1. Browse to <a href ='https://online.visualstudio.com' target='_blank'>https://online.visualstudio.com</a>
    2. Click **Get Started**.
    3. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
    4. Click **Create environment**. If you don't already have a Visual Studio Online plan, create one. This is used to track resource utlization by your Visual Studio Online environments. Then create an environment with the following settings:
        - **Environment Name**: *A name for your environment - for example, **MSLearn-create-deploy-azure-ml-module**.*
        - **Git Repository**: MicrosoftDocs/Train-package-Azure-ML-module-for-IoT-Edge
        - **Instance Type**: Standard (Linux) 4 cores, 8GB RAM
        - **Suspend idle environment after**: 120 minutes
    5. Wait for the environment to be created, and then click **Connect** to connect to it. This will open a browser-based instance of Visual Studio Code.

## Labs

After you've completed the setup steps above, you can use your Visual Studio Online environment to complete the labs.


> **Note**: Labs that involve running code include all of the code you'll need - you'll just need to copy and paste a few values and run the code that is provided, so don't worry if you're not a programmer! We've used Python code in the labs, because that can be runs interactively in the notebooks themselves.
